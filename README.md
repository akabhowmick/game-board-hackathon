🎮 How to Play
Each player starts with 4 pieces in their home zone.
Players take turns rolling a 6-sided dice.
To move a piece out of the home zone, a player must roll a 6.
Move pieces along the Ludo path towards the finish zone.
Capturing: Landing on an opponent’s piece sends it back to their home zone.
The first player to get all 4 pieces to the final zone wins!
